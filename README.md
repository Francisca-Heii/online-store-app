### DESIGN

##### Colour Scheme
The color scheme chosen looks cool, calm, and engaging. Since the site mainly consists of bright images,
 I thought sticking to various shades of green and additional yellow, and violet-cool would look nice together.

<p align="center"><img width="150" height="220" src="documentation/readme-images/ffffff.png"></p>


#### Typography
The site uses a variation of two different fonts that is Bitter, Lato, and Sans serif as a fallback font. It is important to always have a fallback back font when building applications. The reason is that, in a situation where the Bitter and Lato fonts fail to load for unknown reasons that is where the Sans serif backs up and render.

##### icons
The icons used are taken from Font Awesome. All icons that are used have functional purposes such as the hamburger menu for the mobile device and social media icons. 

#### Images
The images used for the project are taken from [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/) and [Home store](https://mandauefoam.ph/). The images are used for products, banners and, cart images.
