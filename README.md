### DESIGN
##### Colour Scheme
The color scheme chosen **looks cool, calm, and engaging.** Since the site mainly consists of bright images,
 I thought keeping the **buttons, navigation bar and text** to various shades of green, yellow and violet-cool would look nice together since the background color of the site is white.
<p><img width="150" height="220" src="documentation/readme-images/250d63.png">
<img width="150" height="220" src="documentation/readme-images/00954d.png">
<img width="150" height="220" src="documentation/readme-images/250d63.png">

<img width="150" height="220" src="documentation/readme-images/ffbe00.png">
<img width="150" height="220" src="documentation/readme-images/ffffff.png"></p>

#### Typography
The site uses a variation of **two different fonts that is Bitter, Lato, and Sans serif as a fallback font.** It is important to always have a fallback back font when building applications. **The reason is that,** in a situation where the Bitter and Lato fonts fail to load for unknown reasons that is where the Sans serif backs up and render.

##### icons
The icons used are taken from **Font Awesome.** All icons that are used have functional purposes such as the hamburger menu for the mobile device and social media icons. 

#### Images
The images used for the project are taken from [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/) and [Home store](https://mandauefoam.ph/). The images are used for products, banners and, cart images.

### Wireframes
**Post wireframes design changes:**
While the project relied on these wireframes, there are some differences between the wireframes and the final product; 
* No spinner icon and background image triggered while Stripe payment is processing.
* An "About Us" page with a contact form was added.

The bitter font is a slab serif typeface, it is balanced and manually spaced, and specially designed for comfortably reading on any computer or device.

 On the other hand, Lato is a popular typeface font that can be used in the entire website. It is commonly used in the body text as it has an elegant look and is easy on the eye.

### Testing ###


## Deployment
### Creation
* All code was written in Gitpod and used [this template](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Org/gitpod-full-template) from Code Institute.
* Files were added to the staging area using "git add ."
* Files were committed to the local repository using "git commit -m 'commit message here'".
* Committed changes were pushed to the GitHub repository.

### Heroku

To deploy the project to a live website the below steps were followed:

* Go to Heroku.com and log in (if not registered you must create an account first).
* Make sure your project has a file specifying which applications are needed to run your site, use the below code to automatically generate this
> pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt
* Also make sure you have a Procfile which tells Heroku which file runs the app. The Procfile may add a blank line which can cause issues so check and remove this if needed.
* In Heroku click on create a new app. The Heroku app name must be unique and generally uses - instead of spaces and all lowercase letters. Then select the region closest to you and create app.
* To connect our app to Heroku we can setup an automatic deployment from our GitHub repo. Within your Heroku app go to the deployment tab and click on GitHub for the deployment method. Make sure your GitHub profile is displayed below and enter the repository name and search. Make sure your repo is displayed and click connect to this app.
* Before enabling automatic deployment, we still have a couple more steps.
* Click on the settings tab in your app and enter config vars as needed for your project. For this project we need SECRET_KEY, DATABASE_URL, AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID, AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY, EMAIL_HOST_PASS, EMAIL_HOST_USER, STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY, STRIPE_SECRET_KEY, STRIPE_WH_SECRET and USE_AWS (True) variables for the site to be fully functional.
* Git add, commit and push the changes in your Gitpod (adding the requirements and Procfile files) as explained in the above section.
* Go back to your Heroku app and the deployment tab - now click to enable automatic deployment and then click deploy branch.
* Heroku will now receive the code from GitHub and build your app, once it is complete you should see that your app has been successfully deployed.
* Now the deployed site is available and should automatically update whenever changes are pushed to GitHub from Gitpod.

### Local Clone
To make a local copy of a repository on your own GitHub account you can clone it.
This allows others to view the original code and/or make changes to it (on their own local copy).
Changing the code on your local repository will not affect the original code or deployed website.

To clone a repository in GitHub you can follow the steps below:
* Log into GitHub and locate the repository you wish to clone.
* Click on the code button (to the left of the green Gitpod button) and copy the https URL given.
* Open Gitpod (or another editor if you prefer).
* Use the "git clone 'insert copied URL here'" command.
* A clone of the original repository will now be available for you locally 
on your own repository to view/edit as you wish.

### Forking

Forking is another way to  make a local copy of a repository on your own GitHub account to do this follow the below steps:

* Log into GitHub and locate the repository you wish to fork.
* At the top-right of the repository (and top-right of the green Gitpod button), locate the fork button.
* A copy of the original repository will now be available for you locally 
on your own repository to view/edit as you wish.

## Credits

### Code

* The Materializecss library was used to help make this website responsive for different devices and to create the collapsible navbar. 

### Content

* For each of the products on the site I had a look at popular sites [Hotel Chocolat](https://www.hotelchocolat.com/uk), [Thorntons](https://www.thorntons.co.uk/), [Whittard](https://www.whittard.co.uk/) and [T2 Tea](https://www.t2tea.com/en/uk/) to gain inspiration for the products on this site. Additionally, these sites helped me get an idea for a good layout of the site.
